## Notes about Programming C (3rd Edition)
### Note to readers on GitHub. This is simply a catalouge of ideas that occur to me as I read. They may or may not make sense or be any help beyond amusement to others than I.

#### Assembler vs Compiler
* Assembly language is easier to understand than binary but each instruction
  still has a one to one relationship with a binary instruction. 
* An assembler simply has to translate assembly to machine code.
* Knowing a lang in assembly only allows the programmer to work on one
  processor because of the one to one relationship.
* Higher level languages differ from assembly because:
** They don't rely on a one to one relationship. Many instructions can be
executed from a single function.
** A higher level language works on all or most processors.
